Let's go through the steps to set up and initialize the project:

1. **Clone the Project Repository:**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/praxxys/qa-engineer-exam
   cd qa-engineer-exam
   ```

2. **Follow the Laravel Installation Guide:**

   Refer to the Laravel documentation [here](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x) for a detailed guide.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Run the following commands in the terminal:
   ```sh
   composer install
   npm install
   ```

4. **Setup Environment File:**

   Copy the example environment file to create your own `.env` file:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. **Generate Application Key:**

   Run the following command to generate a new application key:
   ```sh
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Database Setup:**

   Make sure your database is set up and configured in your `.env` file. Then run the migrations:
   ```sh
   php artisan migrate
   ```

Your system specifications are more than sufficient to handle this setup.

If you encounter any issues during the setup, feel free to ask for assistance.
